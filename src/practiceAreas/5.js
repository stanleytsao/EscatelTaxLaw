			<h1>CA Residency Source of Income Audits</h1>
			<hr />
			<p>California tax law with regards to residency is complex and nuanced and can have significant consequences for a taxpayer facing a residency audit or that may have questions about their residency status.</p>
			<p>As a general rule,  (a) California residents are taxed on their worldwide income; (b) non-residents of California are only taxed on income from California sources; and (c) part-year residents are taxed on their worldwide income while a resident, and only on income from California sources while a non-resident.  However, the term ‘California sources’ is interpreted quite broadly.</p>
			<p>The California Franchise Tax Board’s (“FTB”) residency unit is tasked with determining a taxpayer’s residency status.   This unit is made up of some of the most sophisticated FTB auditors, aggressively pursuing individuals’ whose residency is in question.  Since the FTB taxes California residents on their worldwide income, it has a vested interest in concluding a taxpayer is a resident of the state.</p>
			<p>A residency audit usually involves a deeply personal, factual analysis regarding an individual’s physical presence and subjective intentions, often not taxpayer friendly. Even individuals without any significant California contacts are often subjected to a highly intrusive examination process.</p>
			<p>Escatel Tax Law successfully represents taxpayers subject to residency audits conducted by the FTB and in administrative appeals to the California State Board of Equalization.  With over ten years experience, we help clients manage the seemingly unmanageable body of California residency law.</p>
			<p>If you are facing a California residency or source of income related inquiry or under audit by the FTB, feel free to contact us to discuss your matter.</p>
			<p>Should I add a quote?</p>
			<p>“Residence * * * has an evasive way about it, with as many colors as Joseph's coat. * * * The determination is factual and must be made through a consideration and balancing of all the elements involved.”</p>
			<p>Adams v. Commissioner., 46 T.C. 352 (1966)</p>
