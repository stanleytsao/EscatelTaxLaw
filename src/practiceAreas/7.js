We also counsel our clients on personal planning matters, including powers of attorney (durable, limited or general); and establishment of guardianships and conservatorships.</p>
			<p>Our firm provides advice for specific issues often faced by individuals. We have substantial experience in the area of business planning for owners of closely held businesses, including extensive experience in S corporations and partnership issues.</p>
			<h5>Family Owned Businesses</h5>
			<p>Many of our estate planning clients have significant portions of their wealth invested in an ongoing family or closely held businesses.  We regularly assist these clients with the unique challenges and opportunities faced by private business owners, including the long-range planning needed to transfer ownership and control of a family-owned business to the next generation in the most practicable and tax-favored manner possible.  We provide advice on the tax and non-tax issues involved in the transfer of family businesses, including capital structure reorganizations, buy-sell arrangements, gift programs and valuation issues.</p>
			<h5>International Planning</h5>
			<p>We assist our clients on issues related to international income and estate tax planning by helping them navigate the complex U.S. tax laws, including the U.S. estate tax and estate tax residency status. We understand the delicate, personal nature of designing an estate plan that affects living generations residing in multiple countries, as well as future generations. Estate plans are always based on confidential interviews with our clients. Each plan is drafted to meet a family's specific objectives in a manner that protects the family’s assets, while minimizing estate, gift and income taxes.</p>
			<h5>Exempt Organizations and Charitable Giving</h5>
			<p>We represent charitable and other tax-exempt organizations on the full range of legal and operational issues they confront – including the increasingly complex tax compliance challenges that have arisen as Congress and the IRS have focused their scrutiny on the nonprofit sector in recent years. We also advise private individuals on their planned giving strategies, helping them structure charitable gifts and bequests in the manner than most effectively implements their philanthropic goals and donor intent while maximizing the potential tax benefits.</p>
			<h5>Estate Administration</h5>
			<p>Our practice offers postmortem tax planning and estate administration. We advise estates of all sizes and in all jurisdictions and counsel personal representatives on the preparation of federal and state estate tax returns and income tax returns, and on tax elections and allocations specific to estates and trusts. In addition, we advise fiduciaries on business issues affecting estates and trusts, including the restructuring of business interests, providing advice on the disposition of assets, and representing estates or trusts as shareholders of business enterprises.</p>
