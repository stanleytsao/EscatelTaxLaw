    	<p>These Terms of Use govern your access to the Escatel Tax Law firm website at www.escateltaxlaw.com (the "Website" or "Site") and your use of any materials published on the Website, including any information accessed on or through this Site. By accessing or using this Website, you indicate your acceptance of these Terms of Use and agree to be bound by them. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you should not access or use the Website.</p>
    
    	<h4>No Legal Advice; No Attorney-Client Relationship </h4>
    	<p>The information provided by this Website is for general informational purposes only and is not intended as legal advice or a legal opinion. It also may not reflect the most current legal developments or amount to a full analysis of all relevant facts. Prior results do not guarantee similar outcomes. You should not take, or refrain from taking, any legal action based upon the information contained in this Site without first seeking professional counsel of your choice.</p>
    	<p>Our operation of this Website is not intended to create and will not create an attorney-client relationship with you. Contacting us by telephone, email or other means, or transmitting information to us, will not establish an attorney-client relationship. The attorney-client relationship can only be established after we have determined that we are able and willing to accept the engagement and after we have entered into a written engagement agreement. Until then, do not send any confidential information to us unless we specifically request it. Information communicated without such authorization may not be treated as confidential, secret or otherwise be protected from disclosure, and Escatel Tax Law will not be precluded from representing parties adverse to the sender of such information in any matter. </p>
    
    	<h4>Attorney Advertising</h4>
    	<p>The information presented on this Website may be considered attorney advertising in some jurisdictions. Escatel Tax Law does not seek to represent anyone based solely on a visit to this Site or upon receiving advertising from us, where to do so would not comply with applicable law and rules of ethics. This Website is a communication providing public information about our firm’s availability for professional employment.</p>
    	<p>The determination of the need for legal services and the choice of a lawyer are extremely important decisions and should not be based solely upon advertisements or self-proclaimed expertise. No representation is made that the quality of the legal services to be performed is greater than the quality of legal services performed by other lawyers. </p>
    
    	<h4>No Warranty or Liability</h4>
    	<p>The information published on this Site is provided “AS-IS,” without representation or warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any representation or warranty as to suitability, reliability, applicability, accuracy, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, result, outcome or any other matter. We do not represent or warrant that such information is or will be up-to-date, complete or accurate. We also do not represent that our Site and its published material will be free from errors, viruses, spyware, malware, adware, worms or other malicious code, or will function to meet your requirements.</p>
    	<p>You agree that we are not liable to you or others in any way for any damages of any kind or under any theory arising from this Site, your access to or use of or reliance on the information in this Site, including, but not limited to, liability or damages under contract, tort or other theories or any damages caused by lost data, malicious code, denials of service (including computer crashes), business interruption or other commercial damages or losses, even if we may have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

    	<h4>No Guarantee of Case Results or Outcome</h4>
    	<p>The information in this site may include descriptions of litigation victories or other successful representations by lawyers of Escatel Tax Law. The results achieved were dependent on many factors, and results in one matter are not necessarily indicative of success in another matter (even if the facts or circumstances are similar). Every legal matter is different. The outcome of each legal matter depends upon many factors, including the facts of the case or issue, and no attorney can guarantee a positive result in any particular situation. Any testimonial or endorsement does not constitute a guarantee, warranty, or prediction regarding the outcome of your legal matter. Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome.</p>
    
    	<h4>Governing Law & Amendments</h4>
    	<p>These Terms of Use are governed by the substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to conflict of laws principles. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any of these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition.</p>
    	<p>We may modify these Terms of Use, including our Privacy Policy, at any time. Although we will generally try to provide at least 30 days advance notice of the effective date of any material modification, if we do not provide advance notice, the modification will take effect when we post the change on our Site.</p>
